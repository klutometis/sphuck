* write a quasi-scheme in PHP, such that the metacirc runs almost
  unaltered; may be slower than some PHP-centric strategy, but sphuck
  it!

* environments with non-destructive merging

* type stack with numbers (imaginary component; how to distinguish
  between exact (rational: num/denom) and inexact (float): subclasses
  of number? does each (exact, inexact) have imaginary components?)

* use r5rs 7.1 to inform the lexer/parser; we're lacking booleans,
  vectors, etc.

* README

* parse into some php intermediary before interpreting

* sphuck namespace for lexer/parser
